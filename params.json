{"name":"Garage Door Control","tagline":"This si a pure hobby project to use an [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) with a Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy shield and an iPhone companion app to build a remote garage door control","body":"\r\n# About the project\r\n\r\nThis started as my Christmas 2014 hacking project. I have a very flaky old [garage door from Stanley](http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/garage-doors) and of late the remote control has been acting up. It being somewhat hard do come by spare parts for my exact model I decided to research building my own.\r\n\r\nFortunately the control mechanism is dead simple. The manual control only requires a circuit to be closed and presto the door motor steps through three different modes in four steps when the circuit is closed:\r\n\r\n1. Open\r\n2. Stop\r\n3. Close\r\n4. Stop\r\n\r\nThe manual control consists of a push button attached to wire connectors on the garage door motor. \r\nAll required to connect another control mechanism would be to attach it by wire to the wire connectors and have it close the circuit for a small amount of time to send the desired commands to the motor.\r\n\r\nLuckily this is dead simple to achieve with Arduino and a standard relay component to protect the Arduino from the voltage of the motor and act like the switch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
