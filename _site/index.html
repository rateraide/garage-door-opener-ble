    This started as my Christmas 2014 hacking project. I have a very 
    flaky old 
    <a href="http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com/garage-doors">garage door 
        from Stanley</a> and of late the remote control has been acting up. 
    Since it's somewhat hard to come by spare parts for my exact model I 
    decided to build my own.
    </p>

    <p>Fortunately the control mechanism is dead simple. The manual control 
    only requires a circuit to be closed - like a button press -  and presto 
    the door motor steps through three different modes in the following order:
    1. Open, 2. Stop, 3. Close, 4. Stop.

    <p>The manual control consists of a push button attached to wire 
    connectors on the garage door motor. All required to connect another 
    control mechanism would be to attach it by wire to the wire connectors 
    and have it close the circuit for a small amount of time to send the 
    desired commands to the motor.</p>

    <p>Luckily this is dead simple to achieve with Arduino and a 
    standard relay component to protect the Arduino from the voltage 
    of the motor and act like the switch.</p>

    <h3>iOS Companion app</h3>
    <p>
    I've tried to keep the Garage Opener app very simple and minimalist. 
    My main motivation 
    for creating it was to have an excuse for teaching myself Swift.
